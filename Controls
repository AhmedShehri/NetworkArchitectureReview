THIS REPO is a collection of controls that i feel that are to be checked while performing a network architecture review.


— How and where all components are placed?
      — Routers
      — Firewalls
      — Malware/virus protection
      — NAC
      — IPS/IDS
      — App whitelisting
      — etc..
— How network components are segregated and isolated?
— No cleartext communication port should be in action.
— Determine how firewall rules are established to protect assets.
— Make sure ‘default deny’ policy exists in firewall rulebase.
— EDR protection must be in place to protect hosts from anomalies.
— SIEM monitoring must be occurring within the SOC department.
— DLP (Data leakage protection) solutions must be in placed with well-defined controls.
— Host-based IDS/IPS should be capable of detecting zero-days.
— Application whitelisting is controlled by the organisation.
— Firewall logs must be stored on another centralised server.
— ‘Any Any’ rulebase must be not allowed from any source to destination and vice versa.
— Next-generation firewall should be established which can do packet inspection at the
application layer, determine users, inspect malware payload, content, traffic etc.
— IDS and IPS systems must be in place which has an ability to protect host and network
both.
— Check if the IDS and IPS are placed correctly in the network diagram which protects all
assets of the network.
— IDS/IPS signatures must be up-to-date.
— IDS/IPS should detect port scan and payload injection.
— Check how IDS/IPS logs are stored and reviewed.
— Check administration or management access to the firewall, IDS/IPS. Make sure role
based access management is setup to access such devices.
— Multiple rules must not be contradicted to one another.
— How security zones are created and designed?
